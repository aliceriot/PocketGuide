#The Pocket Guide to Email Encryption

This is a little pocket zine that teaches email encryption (GPG) using
Thunderbird and the Enigmail plugin.

It prints on one side of one sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper, although it may work
fine on other sizes (not tested).

You can find instructions for folding it
[here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zine_Making/Putting_pages_together#Single-page_options).

If you think this would be useful for anyone you know, please feel free to
print and distribute as many copies as you'd like. 

If you spot any inaccuracies or have any improvements/suggestions please
either fork and submit a PR or send an email to <axyridis@riseup.net>.

This work was produced using Gimp, Scribus, Inkscape, and GNU/Linux. 

Happy folding!
