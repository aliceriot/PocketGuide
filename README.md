#The Pocket Guide to Email Encryption

This is a little pocket zine that teaches email encryption (GPG) using
Thunderbird and the Enigmail plugin.

It prints on one side of one sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper, although it may work
fine on other sizes (not test).

You can find instructions for folding it
(here)[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zine_Making/Putting_pages_together#Single-page_options].

Happy folding!
